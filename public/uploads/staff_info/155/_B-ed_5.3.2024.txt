**Slide 2: Why Referential Integrity Matters**

Referential integrity is a critical aspect of database management, ensuring data consistency, preventing anomalies, and enhancing overall data quality. This slide discusses the importance of referential integrity in maintaining data accuracy and its traditional application in relational database systems. We will explore how these concepts apply to the dynamic environment of unstructured databases.

---

**Slide 3: Unstructured Databases Overview**

*Definition and Characteristics:*  
Unstructured databases are characterized by their flexible, schema-less nature, allowing for dynamic and evolving data structures. Examples include MongoDB and CouchDB, offering scalability advantages and accommodating various data formats.

---

**Slide 4: Challenges in Unstructured Databases**

*Lack of Predefined Schema:*  
Unstructured databases do not enforce a fixed schema, allowing data to evolve over time. However, this flexibility poses challenges in maintaining data consistency.

*Data Heterogeneity:*  
Handling diverse data types within the same database can be challenging, requiring careful consideration of how relationships are managed.

---

**Slide 5: Design Considerations**

*Understanding the Data Model:*  
Begin by thoroughly understanding the data model, identifying entities, and determining how they relate to each other.

*Choosing Appropriate Constraints:*  
Tailor constraints to fit the dynamic nature of unstructured databases while ensuring data integrity.
